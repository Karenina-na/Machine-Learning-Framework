# 🤖 Deep-Learning-Framework


## 📚 Introduction

## 🚀 How to Use

Our code repository supports direct downloading and usage, but we recommend using the `git clone` command to clone the entire code repository to your local machine for better code management and updates. Here are the specific instructions:

1.Open your terminal or command prompt.

2.Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the code repository.

3.Run the following command:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/Karenina-na/Deep-Learning-Framework.git
```

4.Wait for the cloning process to complete. Once finished, you will have a local copy of the code repository on your machine.

5.After cloning the code repository, you can use the `cd` command to navigate to the specific folder of the model and then execute the corresponding training or testing script. We provide accompanying documentation in each model folder to assist you in utilizing the model effectively.
